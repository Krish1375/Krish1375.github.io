<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am currently pursuing my masters in Data Science from University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have taken Big Data, Statistical Models for Data Science and Statistical Methods for Data Science courses for this semester. 

I love playing around with numbers and have a deep interest in the field of machine learning and data science. I love reading the active research happening in these fields and try to catchup(lol). I love pondering on ideas with regards to their application in the Stocks and Banking industry as well as Healthcare and Security.
