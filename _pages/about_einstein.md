I am currently pursuing my masters in Data Science from University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have taken Big Data, Statistical Models for Data Science and Statistical Methods for Data Science courses for this semester. 

I love playing around with numbers and have a deep interest in the field of machine learning and data science. I love reading the active research happening in these fields and try to catchup(lol). I love pondering on ideas with regards to their application in the Stocks and Banking industry as well as Healthcare and Security.
